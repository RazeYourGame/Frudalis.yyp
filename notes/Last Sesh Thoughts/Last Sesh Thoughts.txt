FIXED
Possession mechanic works. PLAYER is just invisible and doesn't move, but it can currently track the
coordinates of the newly created POSS_GUARD and will follow them around.

Guard can now return to his home state and patrol around it without getting stuck in waiting animation
Have fixed variable definitions for Guard State, so now can start guard in any state.
Created new test guard, who can currently chase after player and then will return to a set spot. The guard
can also be goaded in between these states to chase the player and break sequence.



BROKEN / THINGS FOR NEXT TIME
Issue where guard will get stuck in ALERT phase if he spots the character at end of PURSUE phase. Will add back in the ATTACK phase and
see if having a break between phases fixes the issue as there'll always be a transition.
When falling off ledges, hitting a wall will prevent falling.
Guards also need to fall faster, to improve sense of weight.
